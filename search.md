## Search API

Base URL: `https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search`

All text values shoud be UTF-8 and url-encoded. The response body will be json encoded.

Note that the search API uses the same syntax as [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). For a full reference of query possibilities, please refer to the Solr documentation. The sections below present useful parameters and patterns for the vast majority of use cases, but are not meant to be exhaustive.

##### Basic search
    https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/query
The basic interface to the ADS data holdings. Query our search engine and receive the cooresponding documents back.  

##### bigquery

    https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/bigquery
Query the database using a seed list of bibcodes. (@roman @aacommazzi we don't have documentation for bigquery; would one of you care to provide this?)

##### tvrh

    https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/tvrh
Compute and return the term-vector components on a query. (@roman @aacommazzi @aholachek please help me to add one sentence describing what this means). The technical documentation can be at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Term+Vector+Component.
   
##### qtree

    https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/qtree
(@roman @aacommazzi I need your input here, too)

## Query parameters

#### q
*required:* a UTF-8, url-encoded string of <= 1000 characters representing the search query. `q` can be used for both fielded (`title:exoplanets`), and unfielded (`exoplanets`) search. See the list of fields [below](#fields). 

#### rows
number of results to return. Default is 10.

#### start
starting point for returned results (for pagination). Default is 0.

#### fl
Specify the fields contained in each returned document. Value should be a comma-separated list of field names.

#### fq
Filter your query results using a particular `field:value` condition. This parameter is repeatable.

* `field` can be any field listed in the field descriptions below
* `value` should be a UTF-8, url-encoded string

#### sort
Indicate how you wish the result set sorted. The format is `field direction` where `direction` is one of `asc` or `desc`, and `field` is a field in the document that contains a numerical value. The default sorting is by relevance (computed by our search engine).

Example of a properly formated & encoded sort param is `sort=read_count+desc`

Some useful fields to sort by may be `pubdate`, `citation_count`, or `num_readers`.

## Fields

Below are some fields noted here for their high usefulness that are available to all API users:

* `bibcode` - the canonical ADS bibcode identifier for this record
* `bibstem` - the abbreviated name of the journal or publication, e.g., *ApJ*.
* `identifier` - an array of alternative identifiers for the record. May contain alternative bibcodes, DOIs and/or arxiv ids.
* `title` - the title of the record
* `author` - an array of the author names associated with the record
* `pub` - the canonical name of the publication the record appeared in
* `keyword` - an array of normalized and un-normalized keyword values associated with the record
* `abstract` - the abstract of the record
* `aff` - an array of the authors' affiliations
* `property` - an array of miscellaneous flags associated with the record. Possible values include: ARTICLE, REFEREED, NOT_REFEREED, INPROCEEDINGS, OPENACCESS, NONARTICLE, EPRINT, BOOK, PROCEEDINGS, CATALOG, SOFTWARE (@aacommazzi didn't we remove/clean up some of these? Could you tell me which, if any, don't belong here)
* `volume` - volume the record appeared in
* `issue` - issue the record appeared in
* `page` - starting page
* `citation_count` - number of citations the item has received
* `pubdate` - publication date in the form YYYY-MM-DD (DD value will always be "00")
* `database` - Which database the record is associated with.

#### databases

The ADS content is divided into a few separate databases: "astronomy", "physics" & "general". By default, queries will return results from all three. To limit a search to "astronomy" articles, add `fq=database:astronomy` to the request parameters.

## Example search requests

Assuming your access token is `my_token`, all queries can be executed by any HTTP client. An example `curl` request is:

`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my_token" https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/query`

...and by adding the following query params, the response will contain relevant documents:

    # Search by bibcode
    ?q=bibcode:2011ApJ...737..103S

    # Search for "black holes", restricted to astronomy content
    ?q=black+holes&fq=database:astronomy
    
    # Search for "dark energy", filter by author, sort by citation count
    ?q=dark+energy&fq=author:"Civano,+F"&sort=citation_count+desc
    (@roman fq won't work in this example until !aqp is the default)

    # Same search but only return *bibcode* and *property* values
    ?q=dark+energy&fq=author:"Civano,+F"&sort=citation_count+desc&fl=bibcode,property

    # Limit a search to only refereed articles
    ?q=author:"Kurtz,+M"&fq=property:refereed

    # Search for "transiting exoplanets", get 200 rows
    ?q=transiting+exoplanets&rows=200

    # Same search but get the next 200 rows
    ?q=transiting+exoplanets&rows=200&start=201

## Advanced Search Syntax

The `q` parameter supports both fielded and unfielded searching:

* `black holes`
* `title:black` `title:holes`

Use quotation marks to indicate phrase searching:
    
* `"black holes"`
* `title:"black holes"`

Prepend terms with "+" or "-" to indicate inclusion or exclusion:

* `+transiting exoplanets`
* `"dark energy" -"weak lensing"`

To filter by a publication date range you can use either the `year` or `pubdate` fields:
    
* `pubdate:[2013-07-00 TO *]`
* `pubdate:[2005-01 TO 2007-01]`
* `pubdate:2013-02`
* `year:2013`
* `year:[2012 TO 2013]`

The default search uses a boolean `AND` between terms, but you may use `OR` and `AND` in combination with `()` to create more complex queries.

Prefix queries (wildcards, `*`) are supported for most fields.
